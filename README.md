This is the project of Todo list made on React library. It lets you create tasks, mark them as completed or cancel this effect, and also you can remove all the tasks you've already completed.
It has minimalistic black-and-white design and just two buttons: '+' and 'Remove completed' buttons. 

When you type a task and press 'Enter' or the '+' button, it adds an oblject of {title: <NameOfaTask>, completed: false} in the array of your tasks. And as you press the task to complete, the value of 'completed' changes to 'true', and program reacts on that by changing the style of the line, appearance or disappearance or changing of colour of 'Remove completed' button.
As you tap 'Remove completed' button, it filters the whole array to leave only the objects with parameter 'completed: false', so you can see only uncompleted tasks of yours. 
As there are no tasks at all, the 'Remove completed' button disappears due to having no need in that. Type a new task, and it will appear.
